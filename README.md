Custom WordPress theme/framework that auto-tweets on slide transition.

Inspiried by @kovshenin and @soulseekah (Gennady) - At #wcsf, Konstantin had live-tweets going on pretty much in sync with his presentation.  Everyone was wowed, and at the end, he revealed his brother was doing it from his account.

Genius.  Now, Gennady can help every presenter auto-tweet great information with their slide presentation.

Utilizes reveal.js
